\subsection*{Deploying the Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning with Highway-Env Application}

To deploy the \texttt{app.py} Streamlit App, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Set up the environment:} Ensure that Python is installed, and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    (\texttt{virtualenv}, \texttt{pyenv} or \texttt{conda} can be used for this).
    
    Install Streamlit and other dependencies by running:
    \begin{verbatim}
        $ pip install streamlit
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    \end{verbatim}
        
    
    \item \textbf{Run the Streamlit app:} Start the app using the following command in the terminal:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
        $ streamlit run app.py
    \end{verbatim}

    This will start the Streamlit app, and it will usually open in a local browser window.

    \item \textbf{Access the application in a browser:} After running the command, the app should automatically open in the default web browser at a local address (e.g., \texttt{http://localhost:8501}). If it doesn't, you can manually open a browser and navigate to this URL to interact with the app.
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Required Files}: The directory in which the app runs should contain at least the following files and directories:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{app.py}: main file

    \textit{style.html}: auxiliary file

    \textit{requirements.txt}: python environment configuration file

    subdirectory \textit{Train\_and\_Test} containing the Python files concerning training and testing as well as the saved models

    subdirectory \textit{images} containing pre-processed tensorboard log plots 

    subdirectory \textit{global\_metrics\_plots} containing pre-processed metrics plots 

    subdirectory \textit{latex} containing latex code for mermaid graphs
    
    subdirectory \textit{videos} containing simulation recorded videos 


\end{quote}
    

\textbf{Required Python Packages:} (Listed on \textit{requirements.txt}):
\begin{quote}

    matplotlib==3.9.2

    pandas==2.2.3

    seaborn==0.13.2

    streamlit==1.40.1
    
    streamlit-mermaid==0.3.0
    
\end{quote}
